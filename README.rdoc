= Tempo CLI

This is a CLI for sending commands to the tempo time tracker (keeptempoapp.com)

== Configuration:

Add a file at ~/.tempo that contains your tempo credentials in YAML form.

i.e.

  username: james
  password: swordfish

== Usage:
  
  $ tempo "command #project @tag"
  
Note: the syntax is defined by the app, not by the CLI.
